# (Dark Souls) Text Overlay

**Stream-overlay to include in Dark-Souls sessions for e.g. the number of deaths**

An overlay that can be managed via twitch chat or via a password-secured webpage, that e.g. moderators can access and edit.  

## Setup

The docker image can be found here: [hub.docker.com/r/flowmo7/dark-souls-overlay](https://hub.docker.com/r/flowmo7/dark-souls-overlay).

Possible environment variables:

* `DOMAIN`: The domain this application is available at, e.g. `dark-souls-overlay.example.org`
* `IS_SECURE`: Whether this application is available as HTTPS / behind an HTTPS reverse proxy (which it should be). Default to `true`.
* `ADMIN_USER`: The username to access the dashboard to change the overlay content. Defaults to `admin`.
* `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The password to access the dashboard to change the overlay content. Defaults to `password`. **You definitely want to change that one!**
* `TWITCH_COMMAND_CHANNEL`: The name of the twitch channel to listen for commands. If not set, will not listen on any chats for commands.
* `TWITCH_COMMAND_PREFIX`: The command prefix for updating the content via twitch chat. Defaults to `!overlay`.
